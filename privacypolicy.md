**Orchard ebusiness Pty Ltd Privacy Policy**

Here at Orchard ebusiness Pty Ltd we're privacy conscious people. We believe that your information is yours and we don't and won't do anything without that in mind. 

From that perspective, we believe in privacy first. All our apps are designed to protect you and we don't capture information that could identify you, where you live or other details about you.

For example, our business apps like our Mobile Business Process designer collects zero information about you. You can still share the process document or the image, but you get to choose the manner in which you do it. We don't collect any information, and we let you do what you need to. 

In cases where we collect information where it is relevant to using the application, we anonymize any information. For example in our fitness apps,  we don't collect information but we collect your location to check the weather so in the event it is dangerously hot or cold to train we want to let you know for your own safety or alter the message to keep you safe. That information is approximated and your location is never exactly sent to the weather service. Again, if you want to share information from the app, you get to share it, it's all in your control.

We want to protect your identity. That's the way we like to feel when we use an app and. If you feel we could do better, let us know at info@orchardebusiness.com
